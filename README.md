Problem 1390   Add the Digits
=============================
Warm-up: Find two consecutive integers such that the digit-sum of each
(base ten) is divisible by 100.

Main problem: Find two consecutive integers such that the digit-sum of
the square of each (base ten) is divisible by 100.

Examples: For the warm-up, n = 1990999999999 and n+1 have digit-sums
divisible by 10: they are 100 and 20, resp.

For the main problem: 4 and 5 are a solution if we seek divisibility
by 7, the squares being 16 and 25. And if we seek divisibility by 10,
then 20248^2 and 20249^2 is the first example, with digit-sums 40 and
10, resp.

Source: Due to Stan Wagon, after a suggestion by B. Recaman of the
squares case with 100 replaced by 19.
